                    <h1>How to train your brain to manage anxiety</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The brain can be tamed like the body. There are exercises to gain confidence and manage stress and emotions</p>
                    <p>It could be a boy from the periphery, from a dysfunctional family, raised in the humiliations of life in a deeply prejudiced society, with poor food, rotten teeth, the day on the street kicking ball.</p>
                    <p>Fifteen years later, millions of viewers are on the verge of a nervous breakdown with eyes and soul riveted to him, a flawless sculpture adorned with a diamond more carats than the age of his ear and a hairdo as brilliant as his Ferrari. End of a major tournament, penalty shootout. The stands erupt in screams and insults, the big shots cling to the money, a huge amount depends on this kick; his companions cover their faces so as not to see him. Nobody would want to be in your place. The boy from the periphery advances firmly and crestfallen towards the exact spot. Ali is alone with the ball in front of the abyss of the goal. Everything around him is out of joint, except his head, a fabulous machine that orders the ball to be executed with the exact force and effect that weakens the formidable goalkeeper. And rock the net. Or not. That's the least of it now. What matters here is the psychological power, the mental strength that presents itself to take this decisive penalty. The path of years of physical and mental training taken by any boy or girl to reach the elite.</p>
                    <p>Great victories are psychological. Rafael Nadal is well aware of this, often physically broken on the court he won thanks to his formidable head. Very few are born with extraordinary physical or mental qualities, but with good training, almost all of us can excel in our qualities; without it, not even the most virtuous stand out.</p>
                    <p>One of the best brain sculptors is the author of the book El Entrenador Mental, Juan Carlos √Ålvarez Campillo, a psychologist specializing in leadership and training of the best athletes and top executives in Spain. With them, you work three essential elements: self-confidence, stress management and managing emotions to achieve your goals.</p>
                    <p>The exercises to train these powers are simple, but, as with all training, you have to start from the bottom, without straining, and daily. "Everything is learned. The mind can be trained like the body, and there are exercises for that, as there are for kicking penalties", explains Campillo. To reach a goal, it is necessary to remember past achievements, to focus on the challenges overcome throughout life. This reinforces an essential thought: "I'm good. I can do this." This is how self-confidence is gained. Then you have to train it with small short-term goals, things of very little difficulty that don't admit excuses and create a habit. Thanks to the plasticity of our brain, this generates neural connections that reinforce the idea that we are capable.</p>
                    <p>It is important to keep away the ideas that destroy this work: it won't work, I don't have time... "We have an internal saboteur that, when we are careless, begins to undermine trust", warns Campillo, "and it is necessary to deactivate it without trying to avoid the thought, because that is impossible. You have to work at it and convince yourself that this is not you at your best, that other times you have demonstrated that you can. Come back to yourself, to what you really are, ignoring these ideas or the opinions of others. Focusing on your goal, observing your achievements and trusting your work and talent. Because these thoughts generate a lot of stress, and neutralizing them builds confidence and keeps that tension away."
                    </p>
                    <p>Controlling pressure and anxiety is another essential strength. This skill is obtained through breathing exercises, concentration and relaxation. Mindfulness, being focused on the ball and not the stands, thinking about the here and now, not the circumstances around us. Stress is the organism's response to the anticipation of the future imagined as threatening. That's why it's important to focus on the present and visualize only future accomplishments, never mistakes, experiencing how someone would feel at that moment of success.</p>
