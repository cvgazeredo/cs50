                    <h1>Procrastinating could be good</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Raise your hand if you don't put off, from time to time, unpleasant, difficult or boring tasks while dedicating time to less "important" ones. Procrastination, a verb that has been in vogue in recent years and refers to "putting off until tomorrow what could be done today", is basically the name we give to a type of behavior of choice. We speak of procrastination when someone chooses to do what is most rewarding or least aversive and delays other more boring tasks.</p>
                    <p>Although some authors try to differentiate procrastination from laziness -- probably trying not to put their readers on the defensive -- the truth is that we are talking about the same thing: a negligence or carelessness with the things we are obliged to do. The procrastinator or lazy person does not fulfill his tasks, has a reduced productivity and, ultimately, ceases to be a "useful citizen" and an "effective human being", as explained by John Perry, professor of philosophy at Stanford University and creator of a of the many methods against this evil. To escape the cardinal sin of laziness, Catholics often go to church and place themselves in God's hands through the priest. To escape procrastination, a deadly sin in the age of efficiency, we have to put ourselves in the hands of so-called experts.</p>
                    <p>Studies on procrastination are characterized by approaching the phenomenon in relation to the individual's personal characteristics and seek to establish what people who put off their "important" tasks have in common. From this perspective, procrastination is conceived as a stable and internal characteristic of the individual, related to the specifics of his personality, a certain brain functioning and the action of certain genes. Thanks to these studies, we know that this is related to high levels of impulsiveness and low levels of self-discipline, a certain inability to regulate moods and emotions, problems in executive function and many other curious conclusions.</p>
