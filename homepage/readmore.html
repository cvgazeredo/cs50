                    <h1>Nine Questions You Should Ask Your Psychologist Before Starting Therapy</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>It's been weeks, maybe months, since anything changes you. When you don't burst over nonsense, you start crying for no reason. Friends try to cheer you up, but you know you need other help, so you get to work to make an appointment with a psychologist or therapist. You intuit that this is the solution, but how do you know if you are choosing the right person? The best way to find out is to not let the professional be the one asking the questions.</p>
                    <p>Among psychologists, as in all careers, there are professionals and professionals. Some are suitable for carrying out certain projects and others are perfect for handling completely different situations. Knowing which one suits you is easier if you can get them to answer the following questions:</p>
                    <p><b>What is your specialty?</b> In Brazil, this question is important because psychotherapy is not a private activity for psychologists, and can be practiced by other professionals, such as psychoanalysts — as long as they do not use the title of psychologist.</p>
                    <p><b>What kind of therapy will we do?</b> It is important to know what the path planned by the professional consists of, as they can be very different, and it is important to be willing to submit to this plan. Every therapist has their preferences. “Cognitive-behavioral approaches the way the individual interprets situations, how he reacts to them and the emotions they generate; psychoanalysis looks for the origin of our problems in past experiences (generally in childhood); the systemic approach works from the position that certain positions occupy in your life…”, says doctor in psychology Silvia Álava. The approach chosen by the specialist will depend on the school he comes from and the type of problem we present him with. “Although he is not completely clear what happens, after a first session the professional will develop a working hypothesis in which he will choose the type of therapy”, continues the specialist.</p>
                    <p><b>How do I know if it will work?</b> Asking you to have guaranteed results is too much, but with this question you can get relevant information. “It is necessary to ask and research whether the specialist's methodology is supported by empirical evidence and whether its effectiveness has been demonstrated in cases such as the one we present to you”, explains Álava. To find out, we can go directly to the therapist or to any psychology board. If a methodology has scientific backing in cases like ours, it is likely to work, but this is not guaranteed: it is also important to feel comfortable with the method. “The chemistry between the psychologist and the patient is fundamental. When it doesn't exist, we can feel uncomfortable in a third or fourth session, and leave without having achieved anything”, points out Dapra. Álava agrees: “It is necessary to create a bond and a therapeutic alliance. The person we have in front of us must give us credibility, and we must trust the emotions he conveys to us”.</p>
                    <p><b>It's time for what matters!</b> You have received a recommendation from a professional who seems competent, and if it were up to you, I would start therapy today. But be patient. There are more things you should be clear about before hiring their services:</p>
                    <p><b>Quanto vai custar?</b> Perguntar sobre o preço é de mau gosto? Nada disso. Na verdade, você faria mal em evitar esta questão. Para Dapra, porém, pagar menos nem sempre é um bom sinal: “Quem cobra pouco é porque não tem pacientes e usa o preço como chamariz ou porque se valoriza pouco profissionalmente”. Também há profissionais que oferecem a primeira sessão gratuita, mas “é uma forma de atrair clientes”, acrescenta. E se você não puder pagar? “Há centros que trabalham com fundações ou estão integrados a mestrados, que são mais baratos”, diz Álava.</p>
                    <p><b>How long will the treatment take?</b> Don't hesitate to ask this question, but keep in mind that answering it is difficult for even the most prepared professional. “It depends on many variables”, says Álava. The main thing is that we are involved in therapy. The psychologist will give the tools, techniques and strategies with which to solve the problem, but it is the patient who must do the work. “It also depends on the type of diagnosis, it is not the same as an anxiety disorder, which has a shorter treatment [between three and six months, on average, according to Dapra] than a personality disorder, which requires tools for a lifetime” , explains Álava. Clearer is the duration of the sessions: “Between 40 minutes and an hour,” says Dapra.</p>
                    <p><b>What if I need medication?</b> “The usual thing is that psychotherapy is enough”, says the specialist, but certain people may need drugs. In such cases, the specialist will recommend visiting a psychiatrist. “The psychologist cannot prescribe medication, and should never do so”, observes the specialist. He cannot even offer us homeopathic remedies. “If you do that, be suspicious”, says Álava.</p>
                    <p><b>Better to ask now than regret later.</b> Once treatment has begun, it is normal for questions to continue to arise. Any phase of therapy is opportune to do them, but it is best to anticipate. These are the questions that may arise during treatment:</p>
                    <p><b>How will I know if the treatment is working?</b> “The best indicator is how you feel, but there are records and measures taken during therapy”, explains Álava. The professional can mention them beforehand. The specialist refers, for example, to questionnaires that the psychologist applies or to diaries in which the process is recorded. In this way, we can compare whether we continue to have the same number of crises as when we started therapy, if we feel as bad as… feels 'average', 'bad' or 'good', but these are not emotions. After about three or four sessions, you are able to express yourself more”, explains Dapra.</p>
                    <p><b>What should I do if I don't notice an improvement?</b> This is where trust between therapist and patient comes into play. “If you get stuck, you must be honest and clear with the psychologist,” says Álava. Only then will he be able to assess whether you need to change the focus, look for other variables that are not being addressed, or know if you are focusing solely on the negative. “There are people who go to the psychologist with the expectation of always being well, but this is impossible in life. It's not about being on top of a pink cloud all day, it's about knowing how to manage bad situations, and the psychologist is the one who will give us the tools for that”, clarifies the specialist.</p>
                    <p> <b>What if I relapse after finishing therapy?</b> “A very important part of the sessions is to work on prevention so that this does not happen, but if it does happen, there is no need to worry. We can go back to passing on the tools and techniques we learned”, continues Álava. In this case, it is very likely that the process will be much shorter: “The usual thing is that in a few sessions it is achieved again”, he concludes.</p>
